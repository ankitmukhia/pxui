## Welcome to Pxui.

Pxui is a modern, open-source UI component library for building sleek, accessible, and customizable interfaces with ease. Inspired by libraries like [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com), its goals are to:

* Provide a delightful developer experience  
* Offer a growing set of reusable, themeable components  
* Integrate seamlessly with modern frameworks (like React)

Check out the component showcase to see how Pxui compares to other UI libraries.

## Prerequisites

These docs assume you have a basic understanding of React and modern frontend tooling (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Vite, or Next.js).

## New to UI component libraries?

If you're new to working with libraries like ShadCN or Radix, we recommend exploring:

* The [React docs]() to get comfortable with component-based development
* [Tailwind CSS docs]() if you're using utility-first styling
* Our [Installation](http://localhost:3001/docs/installation) guid can help you how to work with Pxui
