# Hover slash

It a simple and visually appealing animated hover me button with light orange as base color.

<CompPreview name="hover-slash" variants="default">Hover me</CompPreview>

<Note>This button was designed and coded by <NextLink href="https://x.com/blakssh">Lakshay</NextLink> who I really admire and love the work. I love this button so I copied this button and put it here. So I don't have anything to do with this button. Thanks to Lakshay</Note>
