# Hover slash

It a simple and visually appealing animated hover me button with light orange as base color.

<CompPreview name="hover-slash" variants="default">Hover me</CompPreview>

<Note>This button was designed and coded by <NextLink href="https://x.com/blakssh">Lakshay</NextLink>, whose work I really admire and love. I liked this button so much that I copied it and put it here. I don’t have anything to do with its creation — all credit goes to Lakshay</Note>
