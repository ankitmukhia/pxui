# Welcome to Pxui.

Pxui is a experimental collection of UI components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

It’s not meant to be a polished design system. Instead, it’s my personal playground for design experiments, ideas, and tweaks I pick up from projects, designers on Twitter, and everyday exploration.

Think of it as a living scrapbook of UI patterns — from small aesthetic touches (like buttons) to bigger experiments. I keep adding, breaking, and refining things here, so don’t expect everything to stay the same forever.

- Explore experimental components and design ideas
- Take inspiration or drop them directly into your project
- Constantly evolving, so don’t expect stability (that’s part of the fun)

## Prerequisites

- [React](https://react.dev) (e.g. Vite or Next.js)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) configured
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) installed and set up in your project
