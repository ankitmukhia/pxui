## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.

## Automatic installation

The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `next dev`: Starts the development server.
- `next build`: Builds the application for production.
- `next start`: Starts the production server.
- `next lint`: Runs ESLint.
