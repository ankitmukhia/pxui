# Installation

Pxui is a actionable, library built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It’s designed to make experimenting with design easy — from trying out small tweaks to dropping in full components. The goal is not to be a finished end to end, but a flexible collection you can install, explore, and adapt for your own projects.

### Setup [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project with [shadcn/ui](https:ui.shadcn.com).

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest pxui-exp --yes
cd pxui-exp
pnpm dev
```

### Setup shadcn now. Note: add `-d` for shacn default settings

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init -d
```

### Configure components.json

`init` command askes you to configure `components.json`

```text
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › yes
```

### Install additional dependencies

Some components need extra dependencies. You can install them as you go, or just add them all upfront if you plan to explore widely:

```bash
pnpm add motion
pnpm add lucide-react
```

Add some base shadcn components

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dialog
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add separator
```

### At last, add pxui components

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "https://pxui-docs.vercel.app/pxui/ui/aesthetic-button.json"
```
